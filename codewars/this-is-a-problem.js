// We want to create a constructor function 'NameMe', which takes first name and last name as parameters.
// The function combines the first and last names and saves the value in "name" property.

// We already implemented that function, but when we actually run the code, the "name" property is accessible, but the "firstName" and "lastName" is not accessible.
//  All the properties should be accessible. Can you find what's wrong with it? A test fixture is also available

function nameMe(first, last) {
	this.firstName = first
	this.lastName = last
	this.name = first + ' ' + last
	console.log(this.name)
}

nameMe('Ivan', 'Ivanov')
